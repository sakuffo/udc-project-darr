Primarily it would depend on what exactly failed. To go from least impactful to more impactful:
If the secondary region (us-west-2) OR the az the replica sits in failed (since the replica is not multi-az), for the databse, no data would be 
lost as the primary databse is up and recieving data. The RPO for that failure would be zero. The RTO would be about 15 minutes because while 
there is no data loss and the primary DB is up, there are many cases a read replica could be used to increase DB performance. 
Since a read replica takes abotu 15 minutes with a DB this size to be stood up, I would quote a RTO of 30 minutes.

However, if the failure is in the primary side, again, depends on a few factors. If only a single AZ fails, according to AWS documentation,
it takes about 60 to 120 seconds for the RDS to failover to it's standby (as the primary instance is multi-az). However if there are a large amount
of lengthy transactions, this can increase the time. For safty I would estimate 15 minutes RTO and RPO.
However, if the entire region failed, I would quote a 30 minute RPO and RTO as the read replica would have to be promoted to server write and read traffic.
